Here we are, we've just created a new Play! application named "blogging". Now, we have to populate this project
with minimalistic capabilities, like posting, and user management, not for security purpose, but about authoring.

h2. About the author

McG. well known as McGivrer, is in "real life" Frédéric Delorme, a Java Expert and a software architect, working 
in one of the biggest Computer Service oriented french enterprise. 

Sparing time with small projects and learning new technology like framework (mostly web oriented) and sometimes, 
some new languages (like Ruby and Ruby on Rails).

My prefered exercise, is to bring such technology to our customer to raise there "time to delivery" with a 
shortest lapse time, following some Agile process during project, and the less "customization" as possible, to
keep project in well known Object Paradigm: re-usability.
